# Express Authentication for HS256-Signed Tokens

This sample demonstrates how to protect endpoints in an Express API by verifing an incoming JWT access token signed by Auth0. The token must be signed with the HS256 algorithm and must be verified against the signing secret. 

## Getting Started

If you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://auth0.com) for your free Auth0 account and create a new client in the [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com).

You must ensure that the APIs section is enabled in your Auth0 dashboard. To do so, go to the [Advanced Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/account/advanced) area and verify that **Enable APIs Section** is switched on. Next, navigate to APIs in the sidebar and create a new API. The identifier for your API will be required later.

Clone the repo or download it from the NodeJS API quickstart page in Auth0's documentation.

## Setup the `.env` File

If you download this sample from the NodeJS API quickstart page, a `.env` file will come pre-populated with your API identifier and Auth0 domain. If you clone the repo from GitHub, you will need to rename `.env.example` to `.env` and provide these values manually.

## Install the Dependencies and Start the API

```bash
cd 02-Authenticate-HS256
npm install
npm start
```

The API will be served at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Endpoints

The sample includes three endpoints:

**GET** /api/public
* An unprotected endpoint which returns a message on success. Does not require a valid JWT access token.

**GET** /api/private
* A protected endpoint which returns a message on success. Requires a valid JWT access token.

**GET** /api/private/admin
* A protected endpoint which returns a message on success. Requires a valid JWT access token containing a `scope` of `read:messages`.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).

## Create a free Auth0 account

1. Go to [Auth0](https://auth0.com/signup) and click Sign Up.
2. Use Google, GitHub or Microsoft Account to login.
